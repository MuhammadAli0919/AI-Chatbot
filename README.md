# 🕰️ chatbot

Time Travel Bot is a conversational AI chatbot that lets you talk to any famous personality — past or present — as if you're speaking to them in real life.

## 💡 About the Project

Built as a creative experiment to simulate historical or celebrity conversations, this bot uses AI to generate realistic responses in the tone, voice, and worldview of the chosen figure. Just type a name like *Albert Einstein*, *Allama Iqbal*, or *Donald Trump*, and start chatting.

The idea was inspired by the pressure of learning and building as a GIAIC student — turning that pressure into a fun, educational side project.
